# Programming Assignment #2
ECE5463 PA2 Inverse Kinematics Homework Assignment

TODO:
- Write and verify inverse kinematic equations for RR manipulator
- Create algorithm to read and store user input on graph
- Create function to interpolate 5 input points as a spline curve to act as EE trace
- Create an animation showing the EE of RR manipulator tracing generated spline
- NOTE: Tracing spline outside of state space <|L1-L2|, L1+L2> should not be solved and should follow boundary conditions

- Write Report
    - Strategy (Organization and distrubition of work)
    - Workflow, integration of code and conflict/bug handling
    - Coordination: discuss key decisions 
    - Reflect on what worked and what didn't, include changes in retrospect
    - Individual contributions including functions or commits, time spent on assignment, one skill improved and one blocker
